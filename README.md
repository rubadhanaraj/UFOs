# UFOs
##Overview of Project:
The purpose of this project is to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list and to filter data based on certain criteria using JavaScript as the primary coding language. In this project, 
* The strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+ were explained
* JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases were described
* Built and deployed JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
* Converted JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
* Built and deployed forEach (JavaScript for loop).
* Created a table and dynamically filtered the table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Results:
The challenge in this module was to add filters in the table created with UFO data by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date filter, filters for the city, state, country, and shape were added.
